Step 1: Prerequisites

Python: Version 3.11.
Node.js and npm.
Docker and Docker Compose
PostgresSQL with vector extension

Step 2: Backend Setup (FastAPI Server)
Navigate to the Backend Directory
Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment
Install Dependencies: Install all the required Python packages from the requirements.txt file.
Configure Environment Variables according to your setup and folder dir.

Step 3: Add Your Data
Place any unstructured files (e.g., .pdf, .docx, .txt) you want to index into the MY_RAG/Backend/Document folder.
If you have structured data files (e.g., .csv, .xlsx), place them in the same MY_RAG/Backend/Document folder. The indexing script will load them into the database.

Step 4: Build the Index: Run the build_index.py script.
Process all files in the Document folder.
Create and store embeddings in the PGVector database.
Create and save the sparse BM25 retriever index.
Generate metadata files used by the application.

Step 5: Run the Backend Server: Start the FastAPI application using Uvicorn.
